# Using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-007396?logo=docker" width="110" height="auto" />

  1. Clone the [front-end](https://github.com/katyperrycbt/dorm-management-front-end) app of this application too, it can be found in my GitHub.
  2. Rename this back-end to client, the front-end (step 1) to server.
  3. Download the Docker Compose file [here](https://github.com/katyperrycbt/Docker-Compose-Files/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).
  4. The directory structure should be like this:
        - client
        - server
        - docker-compose.yml
  5. In root directory, run this 
```console 
docker-compose.exe up --force-recreate --build 
```
# Without Docker, things to do after cloning
  1. Install packages
```console
npm install
```
  2. Start the server
```console
npm start
```
